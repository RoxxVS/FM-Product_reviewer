## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Responsive design
- CSS variables
- CSS Pseudo-class

### What I learned

With this work I was able to improve my skill in using responsive units of measurement both in boxes and font-size.

ex.: 

    h6, p.description, a, span {
        (...)
        font-size: 0.9vw;
    }

Taking the screen width as a reference, the text accommodates different devices.

### Continued development

I notice that I still have to continue learning about the properties of flex. I also need to improve when importing and using fonts.

### Useful resources
